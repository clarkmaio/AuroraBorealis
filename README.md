# AuroraBorealis
Package to download, analyse and plot Kp value.

To run the dashboard locally:

  1. Install `streamlit` from terminal: `pip install streamlit`
  2. Clone the repository and use this command from terminal: `streamlit run dashboard.py`


The command will generate an adress like `192.168.1.100:8501`.
You can now reach the dashboard putting that adress on a browser.

Enjoy
